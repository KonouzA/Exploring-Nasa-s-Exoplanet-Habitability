# Exploring-Nasa-Exoplanet-Habitability

Exoplanet Exploration Project
Description
This project explores the Exoplanet dataset, which contains information about various exoplanets and their host stars. The primary goal is to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the properties and habitability of exoplanets.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Exoplanets.csv" file, which contains information such as planet name, host star name, discovery method, physical properties (mass, radius, orbital period, eccentricity), and stellar properties (effective temperature, metallicity, surface gravity).
Files

Exoplanets.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete code for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
Exoplanets.csv: The dataset file containing exoplanet information.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
missingno
fuzzywuzzy
theverse
scipy
math
sklearn

You can install these libraries using the following command:
Copy codepip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn missingno fuzzywuzzy theverse scipy scikit-learn
Usage

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the "Exoplanets.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Make sure the "Exoplanets.csv" file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
Run the Jupyter Notebook cells sequentially to see the data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualizations.

Analysis
The notebook covers the following analysis steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling missing values
Removing duplicates and inconsistencies
Outlier detection and treatment
Exploratory data analysis
Visualizations and insights
